    /**
     * This method returns the savings for advertised bundle savings.
     * Test me in Assignment 2
     * You do NOT have the implemented methods for this but just 5 implemented versions in the .class files in the cls folder. So you need
     * to Blackbox test this method based on the description you get here. 
     * What this method does: 
     * - Bear costs are calculated based on all the accessories, nose makers, material and so forth
     * - Bears are Buy 2 bears, get a third one free. It is always the cheapest bear that is free. If I buy 3 then I pay only for the 2 most expensive ones, if I buy 6 I pay for the 4 most expensive ones. The cheapest is determined after all the individiual discounts are applied to a bear. So the total bear cost is always the bear with all accessories and all bear discounts.   
     * - It is 10% off the total cost of a bear when a single bear has 10 or more accessories (clothes and noisemakers and embroidery) that the customer pays for (so if clothes are free these do not count). 
     * - Clothes are buy 2, get one free on each bear. Always the cheapest clothes are free. Basically same principle as for the Bears buy 2 get one free. 
     *  TIP: the implemented savings method in the BearWorkshop1-5 do not use the getCost method implemented in this base class. They implement their own savings calculation
     *  		 All of them do however use the getRawCost method implemented in this base class. You should test all the constraints that you can come up with, for noise makers, clothers etc. 
     * @return the savings if the customer would check out as double
